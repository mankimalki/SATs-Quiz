## Overview of Year 1 Mathematics
The Year 1 mathematics syllabus forms part of **Key Stage 1** in the UK National Curriculum for children aged 5-6. This foundational year establishes core numerical and spatial skills through concrete, pictorial, and abstract approaches.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Develop fluency with numbers to 20
- Understand basic addition/subtraction
- Recognize common 2D/3D shapes
- Introduce measurement concepts
- Begin simple data handling

---

## Number & Place Value

### 1. Counting & Number Recognition
- Count **forwards and backwards** from 0 to 20
- Read and write numbers **0 to 20** in numerals and words
- Understand **one more/one less** within 20
- Count in multiples of **2, 5, and 10**

### 2. Place Value Concepts
- Understand that **two-digit numbers** comprise tens and ones
- Use **concrete materials** (e.g., base-10 blocks) to represent numbers
- Compare numbers using **<, >, and =** symbols

### 3. Number Patterns
- Recognize number patterns on **100 square**
- Identify odd and even numbers **up to 20**
- Complete simple number sequences (e.g., 2,4,6,__)

---

## Addition & Subtraction

### 1. Basic Operations
- Add and subtract **numbers to 20**
- Understand and use **+**, **-**, and **=** signs
- Solve **one-step problems** with concrete objects
- Learn **number bonds to 10 and 20**

### 2. Calculation Methods
- Use **counting on** for addition
- Apply **counting back** for subtraction
- Begin to use **number lines** (0-20)
- Record calculations using **number sentences**

### 3. Practical Problem Solving
- Solve simple **word problems** with addition/subtraction
- Understand **doubling** and **halving** of numbers to 10
- Recognize inverse relationships (e.g., 3+4=7 â†’ 7-4=3)

---

## Geometry

### 1. 2D Shapes
- Name common shapes: **circle, triangle, square, rectangle**
- Identify shape properties: **sides, corners**
- Sort shapes by **simple criteria** (color, size, shape)
- Recognize shapes in **everyday objects**

### 2. 3D Shapes
- Name basic 3D shapes: **cube, cuboid, sphere, cone**
- Compare 2D and 3D shapes
- Build models using 3D shapes

### 3. Position & Direction
- Understand basic positional language:  
  **above/below, left/right, forwards/backwards**
- Follow and give **simple directions**
- Introduce **quarter/half/whole turns**

---

## Measurement

### 1. Length & Height
- Compare lengths using **longer/shorter/taller**
- Measure using **non-standard units** (e.g., cubes, hands)
- Introduce standard units (**cm, m**)

### 2. Weight & Capacity
- Compare weights: **heavier/lighter**
- Compare capacities: **full/empty, more/less**
- Use simple measuring containers

### 3. Time

- Construct **pictograms** with 1:1 scale

### 2. Data Interpretation
- Answer questions about **simple graphs**
- Compare quantities using **more/less/same**
- Discuss results in simple terms

---

## Progression to Year 2
This Year 1 syllabus provides the foundation for:
- Working with **numbers to 100**
- Introducing **multiplication/division** concepts
- More complex **word problems**
- Advanced **measurement** with standard units

---
